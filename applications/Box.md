## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.


### Overview

Please provide the following:

- We probebly like blablacar or uber.
- Logistics aggregator for delivery via travelers.
- we are thinking of introducing Dot tokens as a means of payment or usdt.
- Because we've been thinking about this project since 2017.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):

we didn't issue our own token, because the rules for funding state that we can't do that :)

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

I'm not very familiar with the rest of the Polkadot network products, and I'm more in favor of offline business, but in general if there is a possibility to somehow interact with other projects it would be very cool.
